The program will read one integer value, and you need to match
constraints set by the program (length and value).

Pseudocode of the program
    1. read a string from the user;
    2. get the length of the string;
        exit if input length is not matched with a predefined value.
    3. convert the input to an integer and then to a string;
    4. apply xor to the string and compare each byte to the password
        exit if any byte of your input is not matched with the password
