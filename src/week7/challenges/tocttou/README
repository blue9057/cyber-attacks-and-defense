This program checks if the filename that you typed is under to your group id.
If it is, it will print out its content, however, it will just exit if
the file is not in your group (not for your effective gid).

Can you exploit 'time-of-check-to-time-of-use' (TOCTTOU) bug in the program
to read the flag?
