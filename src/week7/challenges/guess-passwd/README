Can you guess my root password?
The PASSWD string in the source code is scrambled, but the length of
my password is the same as the length of the string PASSWD.

Password charset: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789

Hint: measure the time
    import time

    t1 = time.time()
    data = p.recv()
    t2 = time.time()
    time_diff = t2 - t1
