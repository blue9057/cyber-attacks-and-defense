In receive_input(),
the program first store the return address to
a global varlable 'my_return_address'.
Later, when the function returns,
the program gets the current return address (stores to new_return_address)
and compares values in my_return_address to new_return_address.
In case if the values in two variables are different,
the program regard it as a case of attack
(because the return address has been changed!)
and run exit(-1).

Under this condition,
can you exploit the program and run get_a_shell()?
