The stack is configured as follows (in receive_input()):

[ebp+0x4]       return address              Can't overwrite
[ebp]           saved ebp                   Can overwrite the last 1 byte...
[ebp-0x4]
[ebp-0x8]
...
...
...
[ebp-0x88]      buffer


The program gets your input upto 137 bytes because the developer made a mistake,
putting '=' in the for loop. Because of this, you can overwrite
the last 1 byte of 'saved ebp' but you can't overwrite other bytes nor
the return address.

Can you exploit this program to run get_a_shell()?
