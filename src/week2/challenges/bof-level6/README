The stack is configured as follows (in receive_input()):

[rbp+0x8]       return address              Can't overwrite
[rbp]           saved rbp
[rbp-0x8]
[rbp-0x10]
...
...
...
[rbp-0x80]      buffer


You can overwrite the 'saved rbp' but you can't overwrite the return address
because the buffer size is 128 byte, and your input is allowed upto 136 bytes
(to fully overwrite the return address, you need 144 bytes of your input).

Can you exploit this program to run get_a_shell()?
