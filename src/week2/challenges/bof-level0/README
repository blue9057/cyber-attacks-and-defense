Stack is configured as follows:

[ebp+0x4]           return address
[ebp]               saved ebp
[ebp-0x4]
[ebp-0x8]           a = 0x41414141
[ebp-0xc]           b = 0x42424242
[ebp-0x10]
[ebp-0x14]
[ebp-0x18]
[ebp-0x1c]
[ebp-0x20]          buffer

Can you overwrite both a and b to make:

a = 0x48474645 and b = 0x44434241?
