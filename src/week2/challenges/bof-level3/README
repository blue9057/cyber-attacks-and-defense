Stack is configured as follows:

[rbp+0x8]           return address
[rbp]               saved rbp
[rbp-0x8]           a = 0x4141414141414141
[rbp-0x10]          b = 0x4242424242424242
[rbp-0x18]
[rbp-0x20]
[rbp-0x28]
[rbp-0x30]          buffer

Can you overwrite both a and b to make:

a = 0x6867666564636261 and b = 0x4847464544434241

and overwrite the return address to run get_a_shell()?
