# Cyber Attacks and Defense

This repository serves as a comprehensive archive of educational content,
meticulously curated to facilitate the progressive journey of
aspiring cybersecurity enthusiasts into the realm of
contemporary cyber-attacks.

It encompasses an array of resources, including but not limited to:

1. Presentation slides offering theoretical knowledge and strategic insights.
2. Direct links to instructional videos for auditory and visual learning.
3. Practical instances, demonstrated through codes and binaries, to provide a hands-on experience.
4. Detailed solutions and explanations to reinforce understanding and self-assessment.

These materials are strategically structured around multiple `pwnable` examples,
each serving as a learning module, to ensure a seamless transition from
theoretical aspects to real-world hacking scenarios.
This approach aims to empower novice hackers with the acumen and
proficiency required to navigate, understand, and innovate in
the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats and defenses.
